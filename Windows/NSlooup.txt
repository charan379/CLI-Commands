Microsoft Windows includes a tool called NSLOOKUP that you can use via the command prompt.
This tool can be used to check DNS records propagation and resolution using different servers, 
and perform other troubleshooting steps.

1. Type nslookup and hit Enter. The default server will be your local DNS server. 
You can specify the DNS server, type of record and a domain name. 
The command below returns the A record for the domain you run a query for.

> nslookup

2. Type
 
> nslookup -q=XX 

where XX is a type of a DNS record.  
Some of the available types are MX, A, CNAME, and TXT. 
The records are then displayed, to exit the tool type exit



To use nslookup as a troubleshooting tool, 
you can set the specific type of record to lookup for a domain by using the 
-type=record_type where record_type is A, CNAME, MX, PTR, NS, ANY.

3. Type 

> nslookup -type=ns domain_name 

where domain_name is the domain for your query and hit Enter 
Now the tool will display the name servers for the domain you specified.

> nslookup domian_name Dns_server
