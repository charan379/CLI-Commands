SLMGR

To display very basic license and activation information about the current system, run the following command. This command tells you the edition of Windows, part of the product key so you can identify it, and whether the system is activated.

> slmgr.vbs /dli

To display more detailed license information–including the activation ID, installation ID, and other details–run the following command:

> slmgr.vbs /dlv

View the License Expiration Date
To display the expiration date of the current license, run the following command. This is only useful for Windows system activated from an organization’s KMS server, as retail licenses and multiple activation keys result in a perpetual license that won’t expire. If you haven’t provided a product key at all, it’ll give you an error message.

> slmgr.vbs /xpr
